## Required Techniques (Must Have):

- 3+ Pages – The website should contain multiple pages with a cohesive theme.

I continued my inspiration board site.

- Framework Integration – Incorporate a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) to enhance design and layout.

I went with Bootstrap. I started by downloading the bootstrap files, and then copied and pasted the bootstrap.css file into my style subfolder. Then, I pasted the bootstrap.bundle.js into a subfolder called 'js'.

I made sure to link my bootstrap.css stylesheet in the head section of my gallery.html.

I linked my bootstrap.bundle.js at the bottom of my HTML, right before the closing body tag. This ensures that the page content loads first.

- Framework Styling Elements – Use predefined styling components from the chosen framework for consistency and visual appeal.

I added a Bootstrap carousel to my gallery page.

- HTML5 Canvas – Include an HTML5 canvas element to display custom graphics or animations.

I added a full-width canvas to my gallery page and drew 5 circles as a potential motif.

- JavaScript Functionality – Add JavaScript to enhance interactivity or perform dynamic actions on the site.

I used javascript to allow the user to interact with the carousel and create my canvas.
