## Project Overview

I worked on my: about.html

### Required Techniques

- Create a page with an external CSS style sheet: I'm continuing my Inspiration Board from last week, working on the about.html page.
- Add hover effects to enhance interactivity: I added hover effects to my navigation links to make them more interactive and encourage the user to explore the site.
- Use an external font that is self-hosted
- Use an external font from a font library

### Additional Techniques

- Experiment with different font styles
- Adjust font-weight for emphasis
- Use text-decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc.
- Adjust spacing (letter-spacing, line-height, or word spacing) for readability
- Align text or elements for a clean layout
- Try pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes for additional styling effects
