# How to Make a Succulent Candle in a Glass Jar

## Materials Needed:

- Glass jar (clear)
- Candle wax (soy, paraffin, or beeswax)
- Wick (choose between a cotton wick or a wood wick)
- Wick sticker and metal holder
- Mold for succulents (silicone)
- Essential oils or fragrance (optional)
- Double boiler or microwave-safe container
- Thermometer
- Stirring stick
- Scissors
- Color dye (optional)

## Instructions:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace
Clear a flat surface and gather all your materials. Lay down newspaper or a drop cloth to protect your workspace from wax spills.

### Step 2: Choose Your Wick
Decide between a cotton wick or a wood wick:
- **Cotton Wicks**: Easy to work with and ideal for standard candles.
- **Wood Wicks**: Create a crackling sound and provide a unique aesthetic. Ensure it's suitable for the size of your jar.

### Step 3: Melt the Wax
**Double Boiler Method**:
- Fill the bottom pot with water and place it on the stove over medium heat. Place your wax in the top pot.

**Microwave Method**:
- Place wax in a microwave-safe container and heat in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until fully melted.

Use a thermometer to monitor the wax temperature, aiming for around 170°F (76°C).

### Step 4: Add Fragrance and Color
If desired, add essential oils and color dye to the melted wax. Stir well to combine, following the recommended usage rate for your chosen wax type.

### Step 5: Secure the Wick
Attach the base of the wick to the center of the jar using a sticker and metal holder. This helps keep the wick in place when pouring the wax.

### Step 6: Prepare the Succulents
Use a silicone mold to create wax succulents. Fill the mold with melted wax and let it set for at least 30 minutes.

### Step 7: Pour the Wax
Once the wax reaches the desired temperature, slowly pour it into the glass jar. Leave some space at the top for the succulents and ensure the wick stays centered.

### Step 8: Add the Succulents
Allow the wax to cool slightly but not fully harden (about 140°F or 60°C). Carefully insert the succulents into the wax.

### Step 9: Finish Pouring
If needed, pour more wax over the succulents to secure them in place, ensuring the wick remains centered.

### Step 10: Let It Set
Allow the candle to cool and harden completely at room temperature. This may take several hours.

### Step 11: Trim the Wick
Once the candle has fully set, trim the wick to about 1/4 inch above the wax surface for optimal burning.

### Step 12: Enjoy Your Succulent Candle
Light your new candle and enjoy the ambiance it creates! Remember to always monitor the candle while it’s burning.

## Additional Tips:
- For a unique touch, consider layering different colors of wax for a gradient effect.
- When using wood wicks, make sure to light both ends for an even burn.
- Always check the compatibility of the wax and wick you choose to ensure safe burning.
