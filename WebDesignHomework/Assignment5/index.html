<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<h3>Portfolio</h3>
    <p>My first idea for a website is to create an art portfolio. I'd like to feature my illustrations and 2d animation work. In terms of tone, I'd like to go with a minimal, black and white design to allow my artwork to stand out.</p>

<h3>Blog</h3>
    <p>My second idea is to create a blog about personal finances. I can feature articles on budgeting, paying off debt, and saving money. For tone, I think I'd like to go with something organic, friendly, approachable, and not too serious.</p>

<h3>Travelogue</h3>
    <p>My final idea is to make a travelogue. I can feature photos and journal entries from my travels. I think I'd like to go with an elegant tone with muted colors. </p>
