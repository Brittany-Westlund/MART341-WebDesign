## Project Overview

I worked on my: about.html

### Required Techniques
- Created a page with an external CSS style sheet: I'm continuing my Inspiration Board from last week, working on the about.html page.
- Added hover effects to enhance interactivity: I added hover effects to my navigation links to make them more interactive and encourage the user to explore the site.
- Used an external font that is self-hosted: I used a font I made called "Kitten" to bring a whimsical touch to the content.
- Used an external font from a font library: I used Arvo, a nice slab serif from Google Fonts, for my banner headings to provide a sense of structure that balances nicely with the custom font I created, Kitten.

### Additional Techniques
- Experiment with different font styles: The quotes on my Home page are italicized for emphasis.
- Used text-shadow to enhance font prominence: I applied a text-shadow to my custom font to make it stand out a bit more.
- Used text-decoration to add underlines: I added an underline to my links as a hover effect for emphasis.
- Adjusted spacing for readability: I increased the letter-spacing of my navigation and heading text.
- Aligned text or elements for a clean layout: I used center alignment to create harmony through symmetrical balance.
